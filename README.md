In this project i designed a website for Hotel Uzbekistan in our city tashkent. Thay have two different  web sites but i created one of them . The site consists of 6 pages. Main pages consists of index.html about.html Tours.html room.html service.html and the final page is contact.html. as i use my elements with more of percentages and paddings it was not so difficult to make the website. In this website i used a variety of layouts of each page and a range of elements for each type. Although i created 6 pages  used only one stylesheet named style.css for all pages and Javascript  javascript.js . In the stylesheet to make my work easier and not to repeat myself i used global classes. Which i used multiple time for almost all of my layouts or sections.
